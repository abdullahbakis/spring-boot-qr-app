This repository contains a Spring Boot application that generates QR codes and stores them in a MySQL database. The application allows users to create new QR codes by entering a message and selecting a size, and displays a list of all generated QR codes with the option to delete them. The QR codes can be scanned and the message will be displayed. This project was developed as a learning exercise and demonstrates my skills in Spring Boot, MySQL, and QR code generation.
